## Statement of Relevancy

Complexity science can be defined as the study of systems that contain many components that interact together and their emergent properties. String art algorithms fall under the umbrella of complexity science since they work by a single thread of string making a decision at each nail (node) it wraps around. The components that interact together are each vector of the string that can create a darker spot if they cross or add a certain amount of darkness along the vector. The emergent behavior we are studying is the abstraction and reformation of the input image as contrasted by the color of the canvas and the color of the string.
